This script systematically monitors internet prices for various goods by accessing to a database containing detailed specifications and corresponding URLs. Upon accessing each URL, the script downloads the page as a PDF. Once the database traversal is complete, the script initiates processing and information extraction. While you may question why we download instead of directly web scraping, our company prioritizes maintaining a record of the information. Unfortunately, I can't share the results due to our company's privacy policy, but I may upload a video showcasing the script's functionality soon.
